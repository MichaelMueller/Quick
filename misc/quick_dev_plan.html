        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Quick was meant to give a basic self explanatory and very abstract PHP web application framework. Usually other frameworks tend to be oversized.</p>
        <p>The main idea for developers is to create data structure definitions. Out of the box, Quick should be able to create basic data CRUD operations (with web page scaffolding) and authorization features for clients while being extendable at any point.</p>
        <h1>Requirements</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Easy data structure defintions</li>
            <li></li>
