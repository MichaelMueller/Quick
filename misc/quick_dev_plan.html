        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Quick was meant to give a basic self explanatory and very abstract PHP web application framework. Usually other frameworks tend to be oversized.</p>
        <p>The main idea for developers is to create data structure definitions. Out of the box, Quick should be able to create basic data CRUD operations (with web page scaffolding) and authorization features for clients while being extendable at any point.</p>
        <h1>Version planning</h1>
        <h2>Version 1.0</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Version 1.0 will provide a typical Database application with CRUD from scratch.<br>
        As a developer, if I am able to create minimal configuration (routing, database info, superuser) and to describe data objects and their relations to each other, the system should automatically provide:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A way with a form to enter and store data persistently</li>            
            <li>A way with a form to update data persistently</li>
            <li>A way or workflow to delete data persistently</li>
            <li>A way to search data using simple text entry</li>
            <li>A way to login</li>
            <li>A way to logout</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Development plan</h3>
        <p>The system will consist of a central <i>App</i> class, an <i>Arguments</i> class, multiple <i>AppFunction</i>, <i>MetaObject</i>, <i>Expression</i> classes. The classes will have the following behavior:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The App object: Routing, Error Handling, data object access and basic config. It gets the Arguments object in a run() method</li>
            <li>The Arguments object: Encapsulates input data from webserver env, command line or programmatically set</li>
            <li>AppFunction objects: The main logic, takes the App object (and therefore with access to the Arguments). Can create a workflow taking "routes"</li>
            <li>MetaObjects provide info about the data (storage type, conditional expressions, ownership)</li>
            <li>Expression classes are objects to restrict storage types in their value</li>
        </ol>
